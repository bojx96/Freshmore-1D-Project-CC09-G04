I’ve just completed the rough draft of how this code should work. I’ve spent numerous nights perfecting this so it can’t go wrong. My wife’s been asking what I’ve been doing in the study all day and night and that I’ve not spent enough time with her in bed. I feel a tad bad but… she should understand it’s my line of work. I’m on the verge of potentially discovering something revolutionary, I can’t stop now! I won’t stop now! I just need to make sure the electromagnetic contraption in my office is working in pristine condition on that day to make sure nothing goes wrong. I’m already so close to making this work and I won’t let anything stop me.

My colleagues discovered some of the files where my code is in. They got curious and wondered why it was password protected unlike the rest of my files. I had to come up with an excuse to convince them that it was nothing much and that it contained some important personal documents that cannot be leaked. Thank God they bought into that argument. No one can know about this project. I’m aware of the risks but, I’ve already spent the last couple of days trying to perfect the code and get rid of any loopholes! There’s no way there can be anything wrong at least with the code itself. I need to be more careful with how I’m going about the whole project, especially when it's something that I’m taking part in on my own.

Today’s the day where the real show starts. I’m going to initialize my code at 10pm tonight in the school’s laboratory. I cannot do it any earlier because a whole lot of people are going to be in the campus and it’ll ruin everything once someone sees me running this project, especially since all school self-run projects are to be declared and authorised by the upper ups. Doing this in the face of others can get me fired and oh… what would happen to my dear wife then? Incomprehensible! Unthinkable! I’ve got to be stealthy about this event tonight in case there might still be some students and staff lurking about the main campus.

I’m in the school’s laboratory right now. I needed to reach early to set everything up and make sure all the neurotransmitters are working fine and connecting to the motherboard of the laptop. Anyhow, they seem to be working fine and the checks of any anomalies do not strike anything out of the ordinary. I guess we’re good to go… I better go grab some food to eat because I’m anticipating this to be a long night. I’ve told my wife to not wait up for me. She seemed disgruntled but, I reassured her that after this, I would spend the whole week with her, away from any work.. if. possible."""

entry5 = """17112020 9:55pm:
It’s almost time. The set-up has been completed. I’m feeling really excited and yet nervous about it, all my hard work shall be paid off tonight. I’ll let you know the results of this project after tonight. But for now, I’ll see you again.
